NAME
----
awsetbg - awesome wrapper tool to set background

SYNOPSIS
--------
*awsetbg* [-fctaFCTA wallpaper] [-uU wallpapersetter] [-m #] [-bB fbsetrootoptions ...] [-rR path] [-l]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*awsetbg* is a wrapper that tries to find a suitable background setting application and then
tries to set the wallpaper using that application. You do not have to configure *awsetbg*, since
it just uses the first application it finds.

Furthermore, it remembers the last wallpaper set, so you do not have to edit anything to change
the wallpaper.

    Set fullscreen wallpaper.
*-c* file::
    Set centered wallpaper.
*-t* file::
    Set tiled wallpaper.
*-a* file::
    Set maximized wallpaper, preserving the aspect ratio. If the application chosen does not support this
    option, fullscreen is used as fall back.

    Set a random wallpaper from this directory.
*-F, -C, -T, -A, -U, -R*::
