If you intend to patch and contribute to awesome, please respect the
following guidelines.

Imitate the existing code style. For concrete rules:

 - Use 4 spaces indentation, do not use tabulator characters;

 - Place braces alone on new lines, and do not place braces for single
   line statement where it is not needed, i.e no:
   if(bla) {
       x = 1;
   }

 - Do not put a space after if, for, while or function call statements;

 - The preferred line length is 80 characters;

 - Use /* */ for comments;

 - Use the API: there's a list of a_*() function you should use instead
   of the standard libc ones. There is also common API for linked list,
   tabulars, etc;

 - Be clear in what you do;

 - Prefix your function name with the module they are enhancing,
   i.e. if you add a function to manipulate a tag prefix it with tag_.

 - Write documentation for any new functions, options, whatever.

A vim modeline is set in each file to respect this.
